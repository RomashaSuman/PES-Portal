The following are the guidelines that we aim to follow in each od the files of our project.

	1. Meaningful Documentation
		- Must describe what is not obvious from a piece of code
		- No code must be left commented out
		- Every function must be documented with a brief description of its purpose 
	2. To avoid repeated code, methods and functions must be used
	3. Neat indentation (for better readability)
	4. Single convention for variable names and function names
		- local variables and function names must be in lower case and '_' is used as separation	
	5. Variable names should be meaningful and describe the purpose
	6. Variable names must be of length between 1-15 characters
	7. The number of lines per function should not exceed 100
	8. All styling must be moved to css files. HTML files contain only markup
	9. All css, js and image files must be moved to the static directory in the Django framework
